  <h2>css이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>Also, if you are totally clueless about CSS,
    it is and how to use it. For a very brief tutorial,
    you can start with the Introduction to CSS 2.1.
    For a fuller, friendlier introduction, pick up a learning
    CSS book that focuses on CSS fundamentals rather than on
    design. Play with CSS in a text editor. Design a few mock
    homepages. Get introduced to selector specificity and 
    margin collapsing.</p>
